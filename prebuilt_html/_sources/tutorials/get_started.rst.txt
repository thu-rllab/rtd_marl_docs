Prerequests and Installation
=================================

You could install dist-MARL on your machine like any other *Reinforcement Learning* projects.

.. rubric:: Requirements for Deploying from Source Code

* System: Linux (Ubuntu >= 18.04 is recommended) with Python 3.7+
* Git
* `Pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ <2.0,>=1.7

Additionally, we provide **Docker** for simply and swiftly deploying dist-MARL.
This is the most suggested way for distributing your training procedure.
In this way, you only need to make sure proper version of Docker is installed on your machine.

.. rubric:: Requirements for Deploying with Docker

* Docker
* Nvidia-Docker-2.0 (for deploying your models on Nvidia GPU)

The full installation instructions for dist-MARL is :ref:`here <chap_installation>`.
