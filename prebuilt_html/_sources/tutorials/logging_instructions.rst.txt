Logging Instructions
====================

Several logging toolkits are provided in MARL.
Here we give brief instructions of how to configure these toolkits.

Usages of ``logging.Logger``
=============================

We offer the customed ``logging.Logger`` in file :file:`src/utils/logger.py` for simultaneously printing output information 
to the console and writing it to the log files.

Given the argument ``common_kwargs.logger_args.outputs_folder`` (defaults to ``'outputs'``), the output folder will be created under the root directory.
The logger file will be named by the name of the module and the created time, from minutes to month, under the directory ``<root_path>/<common_kwargs.logger_args.outputs_folder>
/<run_cfg>/<created_time>-[<remark>]/``, where the argument ``run_cfg, remark`` can be set by appending the command ``--run_cfg=<run_cfg>`` and ``--remark=<remark>``.

For instance, :file:`<root_path>/outputs/sc2_qmix/2023-01-01_18-21-[sc2--qmix_1]/[module-replay_buffer_server-0]-2023-01-01_18-21.log`
denotes the log file of replay buffer module at Jan. 1th, 18:21 run by the command

.. code-block:: bash
    
    python main.py -m RB --cfg=sc2_qmix --remark=sc2--qmix_1

You can log any information by

.. code-block:: python

    # the level is increased from ``debug()`` to ``critical()``
    logger.debug(f"something to outputs, {some_variable}")
    logger.info(f"something to outputs, {some_variable}")
    logger.warning(f"something to outputs, {some_variable}")
    logger.error(f"something to outputs, {some_variable}")
    logger.critical(f"something to outputs, {some_variable}")

The default logging level is ``logging.INFO``, you can change it by setting the value of ``common_kwargs.logger_args.level`` in the config file.


Usages of Weights & Biases
======================================
`Weights & Biases <https://wandb.ai/>`_ is a online *platform helps you streamline your ML workflow from end to end*.
It could track your version automatically and visualize your training data uploaded from different devices.

We've integrate its package ``wandb`` in dist-MARL and it can be activated by simply setting the value of ``common_kwargs.use_wandb`` to ``True``.

Usages of TensorBoard
